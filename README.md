This is my PP2 javascript project for my Diploma in Full Stack software development at Code Institute.
This is a quiz based application created with JavaScript and HTML and styled with CSS.
This is a multiple choice quiz. with a splash page, instuctions, randomised questions and answers to keep repeat users playing.
